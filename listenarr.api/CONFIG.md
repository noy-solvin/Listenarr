# Listenarr API Configuration

Listenarr stores runtime configuration and user data beneath the active content root.

- Local development: launch profiles set `LISTENARR_CONTENT_ROOT=../.env/development`, so runtime files live under `.env/development/config/`.
- Docker: the content root is `/app`, so runtime files live under `/app/config/`. Mount `/app/config` as a persistent volume.
- Tests and specialized hosts can override the content root or SQLite path to avoid shared state.

## Config Folder Structure

```text

|   `-- appsettings.json
|-- cache/
|   `-- images/
|       |-- authors/
|       |-- library/
|       |-- series/
|       `-- temp/
|-- database/

`-- temp/
    `-- downloads/
```

## Directory Purposes

### appsettings/

Contains external application configuration:

- `appsettings.json` - Runtime overrides such as logging levels.

On first startup, the API creates `config/appsettings/appsettings.json` under the active content root if it does not exist. In local development that file is `.env/development/config/appsettings/appsettings.json`.

### cache/images/

Stores cached book cover, author, and series images:

- `temp/` - Temporary cache for newly downloaded images.
- `library/` - Permanent book cover cache.
- `authors/` - Permanent author image cache.
- `series/` - Permanent series image cache.

### database/

Contains SQLite database files:

- `listenarr.db` - Main application database.

### dataprotection-keys/

Contains ASP.NET Core data protection keys used for authentication cookies and related protected payloads.

### ffmpeg/

Contains downloaded FFmpeg/FFprobe binaries and associated license notices.

### logs/

Contains application log files:

- Daily log files named `listenarr-YYYYMMDD.log`.
- Automatically cleaned up by the application according to retention settings.

### temp/downloads/

Temporary storage for DDL (Direct Download Link) files:

- Files download here first, then get processed and moved to final locations.
- Automatically cleaned up after successful processing or after retention expires.

## Important Notes

- The `config/` folder contains user-specific data and should be backed up.
- Database files are SQLite-based and contain application data.
- Temp and cache directories are automatically managed by background services.
- Log files can contain sensitive diagnostic data; restrict access accordingly.

## ExternalRequests Configuration

The application supports an `ExternalRequests` configuration section that controls retry behavior for external scrapes (Amazon/Audible) and a named `us` HttpClient used for US-domain retries when necessary.

Example `config/appsettings/appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "ExternalRequests": {
    "PreferUsDomain": true
  }
}
```

- `PreferUsDomain`: when true, services attempt a retry using a `.com` (US) domain if a localized, redirected, or noisy page is detected.

## Logging Configuration

Set `LISTENARR_LOG_LEVEL` for runtime overrides, or edit `config/appsettings/appsettings.json` under the active content root and set `Serilog:MinimumLevel:Default` or `Logging:LogLevel:Default`.

Accepted log levels are: `Verbose` (or `Trace`), `Debug`, `Information`, `Warning`, `Error`, `Fatal` (or `Critical`).
Log level parsing is case-insensitive. If an unrecognized log level is specified, a startup warning is logged to the console and the level falls back to the underlying configuration or `Information`.
